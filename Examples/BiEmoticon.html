	<h1>Bi-emoticon Pictorial Scale</h1>
	
	<div class="container">
		<p>This example displays bi-emoticon associated with diffferent
			input elements.</p>
		<p>Bi-emoticons can be used to represent imprecise input values. 
		Imprecision is represented by means of a triangular possibility distribution.
		The triangular possibility distribution is the probability-to-possibility transformation
		of a uniform probability distribution on the interval defined by the thumb of the slider.</p>
		<p>The possibility distribution is used to compute a coverage interval whose level of confidence is given by the lingistic term
		with the highest level of certainty. The left hand side part and right hand side part of the bi-emoticon
		are respectively the half parts of the simple emoticons which would have been obtained with the lower and upper bounds of the coverage 
		interval taken as the input.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Double click on the emoticon to open or close the display of the fuzzy partition.</li>
		<li>Click on the corners of the right hand side part of the emoticon to display the right hand side emoticon as a full single emoticon.</li>
		<li>Click on the corners of the left hand side part of the emoticon to display the left hand side emoticon as a full single emoticon.</li>
		<li>Click on the emoticon to recover the bi-emoticon.</li>
		<li>Click on the right mouse button and use the mouse scroll button to modify the thumb of the slider.</li>
		</ul>
